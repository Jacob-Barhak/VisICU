FIB	Plasma fibrinogen (normal: 170-340 mg/dl) A  protein required for coagulation.
PLT	Platelet count (normal: > 150,000/mm3). Low  values indicate a coagulation defect or excessive  loss of platelets (continued bleeding, etc.).
PT	Prothrombin time (normal control values are  indicated by PT; patient's values are listed as  PT1 or PT2; in seconds).  Elevated values indicate  coagulation defects.
PT1	Prothrombin time (normal control values are  indicated by PT; patient's values are listed as  PT1 or PT2; in seconds).  Elevated values indicate  coagulation defects.
PT2	Prothrombin time (normal control values are  indicated by PT; patient's values are listed as  PT1 or PT2; in seconds).  Elevated values indicate  coagulation defects.
PTT	Partial thromboplastin time (same nomenclature as  PT).  Elevated values indicate coagulation defects.
PTT1	Partial thromboplastin time (same nomenclature as  PT).  Elevated values indicate coagulation defects.
PTT2	Partial thromboplastin time (same nomenclature as  PT).  Elevated values indicate coagulation defects.
ALB	Serum albumin (normal: 3.5-5.5 g/dl)
ALT	Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) (normal: 10-40 U/L)   High levels have a similar significance as for AST.
AST	Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) (normal: 10-40 U/L)  High levels of this enzyme indicate liver cell damage.
BILITOTAL	Total bilirubin (normal: 0.3-1.0 mg/dl)
BUN	Blood urea nitrogen.  A measurement of kidney  function (normal: 6-26 mg/dl).  Increased levels  indicate renal insufficiency.
CL	Serum chloride (normal: 98-106 mEq/L)
CR	Serum creatinine (normal:0.5-1.5 mg/dl) another  indicator of renal function; high levels indicate  renal insufficiency.
GLU	Blood glucose (normal (fasting): 70-110 mg/dl)
IONCA	Serum ionized calcium (normal: 2.3-2.8 mEq/L)
K	Serum potassium (normal: 3.5-5 mEq/L)
MG	Serum magnesium (normal: 1.5-2.5 mEq/L)
NA	Serum sodium (normal: 136-145 mEq/L)
NH3	Whole blood ammonia (normal: 80-110 mcg/dl)  Elevated in patients with liver disease.
PHOS	Serum inorganic phosphate (normal: 3-4.5 mg/dl)
TP	Serum total protein (normal: 5.5 - 8 g/dl)
TRIG	Serum triglycerides (normal: 40-130 mg/dl)
HCT	Hematocrit (normal: 35-45%) Indicates the  concentration of red cells in blood.
HGB	Hemoglobin concentration (normal: 10-14.5 g/dl)  An indicator of the oxygen-carrying capacity of  blood.
MCH	Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (normal: 27 pg.)
MCHC	Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration  (normal:34 g/dl )
MCV	Mean corpuscular (i.e., red blood cell) volume  (normal: 80 fl.)
RBC	Red blood cell count (normal: 3.8-5.0 million/mm3)
WBC	White blood cell count (normal: 4,500-10,000/mm3)
BICARBART	Arterial sodium bicarbonate concentration (normal:  21-27 mEq/L)
CO2	Plasma CO2 content (normal: 21-30 mEq/L)  
O2SATART	Arterial O2 saturation as measured via blood gas  (normal: 95-99%)
PCO2ART	PaCO2 measured via arterial blood gas analysis  (normal: 35-45 mmHg)
PHART	Arterial pH (normal: 7.38-7.42)
PO2ART	PaO2 measured via arterial blood gas analysis  (normal: 95-105 mmHg)
